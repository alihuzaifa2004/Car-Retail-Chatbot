# 🚗 CarWala Pakistan - AI Car Retail Assistant

An intelligent AI-powered showroom assistant built using **Streamlit**, **Groq LLM**, and a structured vehicle inventory database.

The chatbot simulates a real car dealership experience by helping customers:

* Search available vehicles
* View car details
* Retrieve vehicle images
* Check prices and mileage
* Ask inventory-related questions
* Schedule appointments and test drives
* Interact naturally with an AI showroom representative

---

## 🌟 Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Showroom Assistant

The assistant uses **Llama 3.1 8B Instant** via Groq to provide natural and conversational responses.

### 🚘 Live Inventory Search

Users can ask questions such as:

* Do you have a Corolla?
* Show Honda Civic pictures
* What is the price of BFB-892?
* Tell me about Land Cruiser inventory

The assistant searches the inventory database and returns relevant information.

### 🖼 Vehicle Image Retrieval

The chatbot can display images of vehicles directly from inventory records.

Example:

```text
Show me Corolla images
```

### 🔍 License Plate Lookup

Supports direct vehicle retrieval using registration numbers.

Example:

```text
Tell me about CY-9081
```

### 🧠 Context-Aware Conversations

The assistant remembers recent conversation context and understands follow-up questions.

Example:

```text
User: Show Corolla images
User: What is the price of the first one?
```

### 📅 Appointment & Test Drive Requests

Users can request:

* Vehicle reservations
* Test drives
* Purchase appointments

### 🚫 Out-of-Stock Detection

If a customer asks about a vehicle not available in inventory, the assistant politely informs them.

Example:

```text
Do you have a Prius?
```
